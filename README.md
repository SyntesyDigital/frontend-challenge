# Frontend Assigment: Github username searcher


## Description

For this assigment, you should consume the public [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps#users) in order to present the github data of a given user.

The web app must have two pages:

- <b>Search page</b>: the user types a Github username in a form. Once the form is submitted, the data is fetched and presented in the UI. You can come up showing whatever you want, though it is required to show the user profile metadata (example: avatar picture, name, email, bio, etc.) and his repositories metadata info (example: name, description, URL, etc.)

- <b>History page</b>: the page must show all previous terms searched by the user, sorted by timestamp. The most recent ones must be on the top. The user must be able to click in the history item and search again using the searched term. If the user close and open the browser, the history must be shown.

Share your solution via URL to your git repository or send us a zip file with the source.


## Stack

In your assigment, you are required to use:
- React
- Redux
- Typescript <b>(for bonus points)</b>

## Review

During the assessment, we will look into the following points:

* Whether you use Redux, React, HTML and CSS properly
* Code organization (modularity, dependencies between modules, naming, etc)
* SOLID principles
* Error handling
* Assignment completion

## Hints

* You don't need to spend time creating a dev/build environment. You can use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (and other alike tools) for that
* Third-party libraries are allowed
* As a company, we believe that communication is the key to success. So if something is not clear to you, or if you have doubts on what you can use, reach the devs


## That's it!

Happy coding!
